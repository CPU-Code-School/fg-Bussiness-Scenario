/* Hi I am the owner of a very large company and I am opening a library for the Jewish community.
Please put together a database with data that will help this library run smoothly.
I would like that in this data there should be the following collumns:
LastName,
FirstName,
BookName,
BookAuthor,
BookType,
DateTookOut,
DateReturned,
GoodCondition,
TotalBalance,
PreviousPaid

Please put as many possible constraints that you can think of.
(Don't make yourself crazy, use your commen sense.)
If you would like, I will obviously pay you more if you test the constraints. :)

Here is some real sample data:

'Stay Happy', 'Libby Weiss', 'Kids', 'Lasker', 'Sarah', 08-07-2021, 08-25-2021, 1, 0, 0
'Don''t Mess', 'Chavy Gross', 'Adult', 'Roth', 'Shira', 09-07-2021, 09-20-2021, 0, '5.00', 0
'Sparkle', 'Dov Hirsch', 'Adult', 'Green', 'Chaim', 10-07-2020, 01-08-2021, 1, '25.00', 0
'Middos Book', 'Rachel Heller', 'Kids', 'Freid', 'Miri', 09-07-2021, 09-28-2021, 1, 0, 0
'Power Hungry', 'Dov Hirsch', 'Adult', 'Neiman', 'Perele', 05-15-2020, 06-24-2020, 1, 0, 0
'Twin and Toys', 'Shira Sinsly', 'Kids', 'Lasker', 'Sarah', 08-07-2021, 08-25-2021, 1, 0, 0

Please add another 3 more of your own leaving out the money part and make the date returned be a date before today.

there are a few lists I would like to be able to access easily:

--1: Show all but group by full name. (one collumn should be the name and the next collumn should be this list of all the books that were taken out)

--2: Show a list of those that have a balance more that $20 and they don't have any books from the library.

--3: Show a list of books that are available to take out and their condition should be very good.

--4: Show 2 lists, one for adult books and the other kids. Please order by book name.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!

Time and quality important so please keep that in mind as you work.
Please keep track of how many hours you worked on it and there may be a bonus!!!
Good luck!!!
